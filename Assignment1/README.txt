WELCOME TO THE ROOMBA SIMULATION:

This simulation demonstrates a simple reflex
agent in the form of a vacuum cleaner. The environment
consists of dirt piles (vacuum wants to suck), furniture
(vacuum wants to avoid), and a goal space (vacuum wants
to end up there). A point system exists to determine the
success of the robot.

To run the code:

1. Compile all files with:
>javac RoombaMain.java Roomba.java RoombaMap.java

2. Place map file(s) in the folder with java files

2. Run RoombaMain and follow instructions with:
>java RoombaMain
